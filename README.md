mvc-invoker-cs2php
==================

A simple PHP-based route interpreter, model binder, and controller invoker. Recently a project required that I use PHP, and something basic like this seemed necessary and fun to create.  Written in C# and translated to PHP using the wonderful cs2php tool by Piotr Isukces.
